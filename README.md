# TextClassifier

This is a text-classifier using nerual networks ,the data is book reviews which are obtained by my teammates using web crawler.

I use the pretrained embeddings which are download from a CSDN blog .The blogger says he using 120G corpus to train the 60W+ chinese word vectors by word2vec.But I can't say that those are good.

By now,I have three indepentent model:TextCNN,TextLSTM and bi-LSTM with attention.
